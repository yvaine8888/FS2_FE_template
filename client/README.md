# Frontend Client

The main project documentation now lives in the [root-level README](../README.md). If you need the original Create React App reference material, it has been preserved in [`docs/CRA_REFERENCE.md`](../docs/CRA_REFERENCE.md).

This folder contains the React frontend that consumes the server API described in the repository guide.
